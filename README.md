# MCMC-Brown-Dwarf-Binary-Analysis
Statistical analysis of brown dwarf binaries exploring how age relates to binary fraction using Python and Bayesian inference.

This project analyzes the relationship between **age** and **binary fraction** in brown dwarfs using astrophysical datasets.

## 🚀 Overview
The analysis investigates whether younger brown dwarfs are more likely to exist in binary systems than older ones.  
It applies both **frequentist** and **Bayesian** statistical methods to compare the properties of binary and non-binary systems.

## 🧠 Techniques Used
- Data cleaning and organization with `pandas` and `numpy`
- Monte Carlo simulation to estimate distribution of mean ages
- z-tests to test significance of differences in means
- Bayesian inference to compare probabilities of youth evidence
- Data visualization with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`

## 📊 Key Results
- The binary fraction for young brown dwarfs was significantly higher than for older ones.
- Bayesian posterior distributions confirmed stronger youth evidence in binary systems.

## 🧰 Tools
Python, pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels
